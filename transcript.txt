[432.25998] Speaker 0: Whisper API.
[435.13998] Speaker 0: Whisper API.
[436.18] Speaker 0: I'll come up with whisper search or transcribing audio with whisper.
[443.315] Speaker 0: So, yeah, these packages are installed.
[492.425] Speaker 0: Let's see how it performs.
[494.425] Speaker 0: And we'll open API key.
[496.50497] Speaker 0: We'll be able to use it.
[498.13998] Speaker 0: But it says, I'll install Numpy.
[503.9] Speaker 0: Let me see if it works.
[506.205] Speaker 0: Looking in indices.
[511.245] Speaker 0: This should run and by the way open Ffmpeg.
[564.68] Speaker 0: So let's wait for FFmpeg to install or just use it.
[587.655] Speaker 0: Or inapplet.nix file, ffmpeg add or download and install.

[687.52] Speaker 0: The audio.
[688.08] Speaker 0: Mp3 API is equal to OS.getenvor open AI key.
[736.38] Speaker 0: Or I think, I think this should be good.
[738.7] Speaker 0: So here we go, we can use open ai.
[742.82495] Speaker 0: Apikey is equal to os.getenv.
[746.26495] Speaker 0: Oops.
[746.58496] Speaker 0: I'm gonna use open ai.
[750.28] Speaker 0: Openai.apikey is equal to west.getenvopenai key.
[798.87] Speaker 0: OpenAI whisper is an amazing thing and it is something that you will definitely use.
[802.87] Speaker 0: You can understand how powerful it is and how to use it.
[805.97504] Speaker 0: Oh my god.

[813.495] Speaker 0: The other side is if I'm not, if I'm not wrong.
[838.005] Speaker 0: Translate English.
[846.01] Speaker 0: Translate English.
[847.29004] Speaker 0: Let's try this out.
[848.09] Speaker 0: I can audio record.
[858.615] Speaker 0: That's it.
[859.09503] Speaker 0: Many recording to save it.
[860.935] Speaker 0: Show in folder.
[865.09] Speaker 0: And instead of saying audio.mp3 one model.
[913.515] Speaker 0: This is really very impressive.
[914.875] Speaker 0: Yeah.
[915.03503] Speaker 0: This is really very impressive.
[943.075] Speaker 0: Import but, there is a better way.
[945.075] Speaker 0: I can generate, give me a Flask minimal template which serves which serves a form that takes, that takes an audio file as an input and uploads it to the static folder.
[969.78] Speaker 0: Let's see here.
[970.5] Speaker 0: I'll show you what I'm doing.
[973.06] Speaker 0: Oh wow.
[973.86] Speaker 0: Oh wow.
[974.9] Speaker 0: So whenever I get from Flask, import Flask, request, redirect and definitely, I can check.
[1020.39996] Speaker 0: Main.py, I guess for some reason main.py is here main.py.
[1025.52] Speaker 0: Let's run it now.
[1026.72] Speaker 0: So when you do Python main.py here, however, put 5 1,000 open for use the 0.0.0.0 to open the port to web traffic.
[1036.105] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1036.585] Speaker 0: So we can't go to 0 and let's see.
[1072.02] Speaker 0: I'll just upload a click on it.
[1073.8601] Speaker 0: You can use a static directory.
[1106.99] Speaker 0: You might want to, you know, update this template or bootstrap you'll use.
[1112.11] Speaker 0: But I'll use this.
[1112.99] Speaker 0: Or you'll need to and at the same time, that is something to give me.
[1160.71] Speaker 0: Uploads.
[1161.35] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1161.59] Speaker 0: So I'll try to make sure I click on static.
[1164.07] Speaker 0: Instead of uploads, I'll try to start.
[1165.9099] Speaker 0: Or here.
[1170.505] Speaker 0: URL for uploaded file.
[1172.025] Speaker 0: Here.
[1173.225] Speaker 0: So this is not found.
[1187.575] Speaker 0: Upload.
[1229.68] Speaker 0: Instead, I'll return the transcript.
[1234.3201] Speaker 0: Okay?
[1234.88] Speaker 0: So instead of saying this, I'll open JSON if I import Or I'll call you Jsonify transcript.
[1246.345] Speaker 0: That's it.
[1267.2101] Speaker 0: And let's try to run the server.
[1269.13] Speaker 0: 'Current terminated triple quote' okay.
[1271.53] Speaker 0: 'I'll try to run return triple dot redirect.
[1276.615] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1277.3351] Speaker 0: So here we are returning.
[1278.6951] Speaker 0: I don't know why we are returning.
[1280.76] Speaker 0: But I think we are good to go now.
[1282.36] Speaker 0: So, if you are using the file, you can upload the file or file.
[1285.16] Speaker 0: Once you upload it, you can upload it.
[1306.985] Speaker 0: Amazing.
[1307.385] Speaker 0: Yeah.
[1307.4651] Speaker 0: Amazing.
[1308.425] Speaker 0: So this web interface is my channel.

[1311.365] Speaker 0: I'll be back on the web interface.
[1314.745] Speaker 0: I'll make cheese or something.
[1316.665] Speaker 0: I can We currently support the following languages through both transcription and translations end point.
[1335.5299] Speaker 0: Instead of digging the documentation, change this code to translate to Bengali.
[1340.245] Speaker 0: I will run it.
[1343.285] Speaker 0: I will use my target language is equal to bn.
[1346.485] Speaker 0: Oops.
[1347.925] Speaker 0: Control zed.
[1349.365] Speaker 0: In fact, we'll get started.
[1353.9199] Speaker 0: We'll change this to translate to Bengali.
[1391.975] Speaker 0: My name is Hari, and I will teach you how to use OpenAI.
[1394.935] Speaker 0: Target language bn.
[1397.23] Speaker 0: So let me see what is wrong.
[1399.87] Speaker 0: In fact, target language is equal to bn.
[1405.595] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1405.755] Speaker 0: So it seems that language is equal to Mujid Alnabodega, but let me try it.
[1409.915] Speaker 0: Target language is equal to PN.
[1412.635] Speaker 0: Let's try to run it or Python or old main dot py.
[1419.16] Speaker 0: Let's see.
[1420.28] Speaker 0: Or API key.
[1423.7351] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1423.895] Speaker 0: Let's do one thing here.
[1424.8551] Speaker 0: Yeah.
[1425.015] Speaker 0: But target language change.
[1426.125] Speaker 0: I'll change language.
[1471.5399] Speaker 0: Translation is copy or simply copy and instead of saying here, me's bang volume directly translate.
[1488.65] Speaker 0: Response is equal to openai.chatcompletion.complete.
[1494.25] Speaker 0: Sorry.
[1494.73] Speaker 0: Create.
[1495.415] Speaker 0: We have a API reference.
[1496.815] Speaker 0: We have a model.
[1499.335] Speaker 0: Sorry.
[1499.575] Speaker 0: Completion.
[1499.975] Speaker 0: We have GPT-four completion.
[1501.575] Speaker 0: We have a example of this basically We have to use Python.
[1507.25] Speaker 0: Completion dot create.
[1509.01] Speaker 0: And this is a text.
[1512.225] Speaker 0: This is indeed a text.
[1516.065] Speaker 0: Gpt forecast.
[1518.865] Speaker 0: Gpt examples translate role system paste.
[1555.61] Speaker 0: So you can paste it in the rule system context that you are a helpful assistant.
[1561.485] Speaker 0: In fact, I'm using the system.
[1576.985] Speaker 0: Role user or role user or content dot complete messages or, role system.
[1632.475] Speaker 0: Or is equal to role is not defined.
[1637.275] Speaker 0: Messages is equal to double quotes and yes, it indeed ran or but do not choose or upload and let's see.
[1662.0901] Speaker 0: Is not of type string.
[1663.37] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1663.6901] Speaker 0: So you can see, invalid request error.
[1666.65] Speaker 0: My name is Harry.

[1671.1051] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1671.745] Speaker 0: So I'll try to transcribe.text.
[1676.0651] Speaker 0: I think this will fix it.
[1678.49] Speaker 0: Because we'll text it now, which makes sense.
[1681.21] Speaker 0: Let's continue.
[1682.57] Speaker 0: Okay.
[1682.7032] Speaker 0: I hope that I run request.

[1761.26] Speaker 0: Language is equal to request dot form language.
[1765.5] Speaker 0: Okay?
[1765.5801] Speaker 0: Or I will make a HTML.
[1767.5801] Speaker 0: In fact, in HTML, I might want to render template.
[1773.275] Speaker 0: So I will return render template index.
[1775.97] Speaker 0: HTML or folder.

[1870.375] Speaker 0: Index.
[1870.775] Speaker 0: HTML is not found.
[1873.415] Speaker 0: Render template argument index.
[1878.53] Speaker 0: HTML not found.
[1880.13] Speaker 0: Templates.
